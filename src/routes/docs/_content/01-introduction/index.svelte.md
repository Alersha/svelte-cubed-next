## What is Svelte Cubed?

Svelte Cubed is a component library for building [Three.js](https://threejs.org) scene graphs in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. In the same way that Svelte **declaratively** abstracts over all the messiness of **imperatively** building and updating the DOM, Svelte Cubed makes it easy to build state-driven 3D graphics.
